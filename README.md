# Calendar and Reminder Application

This is a simple desktop application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to add and view reminders for specific dates and times.

The project was created to practice object-oriented programming concepts and basic GUI development in Python.

## Features
- Add reminders with time and description
- Background checking of reminders
- Notification popup when a reminder time is reached
- Local storage of reminders using a JSON file

## Project Structure
- `app.py` handles the user interface and application flow
- `reminder_manager.py` handles reminder data and file storage
- `reminders.json` is used to store reminder information locally

The structure is kept simple to make the code easy to understand and modify.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter
- JSON

## Limitations
- Designed for single-user local use
- Uses file-based storage instead of a database
- Notification system is basic

## What I Learned
- Applying OOP concepts in a real project
- Creating GUI applications using Tkinter
- Handling background tasks without blocking the UI
- Organizing code into simple, reusable components
